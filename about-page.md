# Meet Lily Lau
## HCPC Registered Arts Therapist (Dramatherapist)

Originally from Hong Kong, I am a British registered dramatherapist who uses drama and creativity to support emotional and psychological wellbeing. My approach combines evidence-based therapeutic techniques with the healing power of creative expression.

## My Specializations

I have extensive experience working with:

### Dramatherapy
Using drama, role-play, and creative storytelling to explore emotions and develop coping strategies in a safe, supportive environment.

### CBT-T (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) for Eating Disorders 
A structured, evidence-based and time-sensitive approach designed to target the core mechanisms that maintain disordered eating behaviors.This 10-session model offers effective treatment for eating disorders. 

Therapy focuses on:
Reducing dietary restraint and body image disturbance

Supporting long-term recovery through relapse prevention
Delivered in a compassionate, collaborative setting, CBT-Ten empowers clients to break free from the cycle of disordered eating and reclaim psychological well-being.

### GSH (Guided Self-Help)
Empowering clients with practical tools for managing eating disorders and building healthy relationships with food and body image.

### Play-Based Therapy
Particularly effective for individuals with ASD and developmental delays, using play as a natural medium for expression and learning.

## Beyond Therapy
I'm passionate about community involvement and maintain an active lifestyle including:
- Taekwondo (I'm also a registered coach and referee!)
- Swimming and cycling
- Gardening
- Learning British Sign Language

**Fun fact:** I'm trilingual and fluent in English, Cantonese, and Mandarin, allowing me to serve diverse communities effectively.
